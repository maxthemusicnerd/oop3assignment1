 * The {@code BubbleSort} class provides an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

 * This sorting algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
 * The process continues until no more swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.
 * <br><br>
 * The algorithm runs in O(nÂ²) time complexity in the worst and average cases, 
 * but it has an optimized version with an early exit when no swaps occur, improving efficiency on nearly sorted data.
